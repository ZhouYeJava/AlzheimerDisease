###Alzheimer Disease Project

This is my Alzheimer's Disease Project in JHU corresponding for my master in statistics
The goal of this project is to provide a aggregate biomarker (ADPS) for Alzheimer's Disease and we perform three tasks to evaluate its performance. 

* ADNI_Data_Generator.R: code to generate ADNI data set
* PPMI_Process_Data.R: code to generate PPMI data set (this is a side project)
* classification.R: predict transition from MCI to AD (task 1)
* sample_size.R: sample size computation (task 2)
* cox.R: cox proportional hazard model (task 3)
